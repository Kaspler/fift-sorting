# fift-sorting

Implementation of sorting algorithms in the programming language Fift.

Currently, only bubble sort is implemented. 

Example:

    "./bubblesort.fif" include
    
    // Put elements to sort in the stack
    5 1 3 2 4 
    // Sort 5 last elements
    5 bubblesort
    .s

    // Reverse 5 top-most stack elements
    5 0 reverse
    .s

Fift is a new programming language specifically designed for creating and managing TON Blockchain smart contracts, and its features used for interaction with the TON Virtual Machine and the TON Blockchain.
